This is a remix of the original gridfinity glue up jig with smaller magnet holes so you can press-fit them.

You will also need to print one of the bases from the original [Gridfinity Bin Magnet Jig](https://www.printables.com/model/559220-gridfinity-bin-magnet-jig).

For fitting the magnets use a tool like the [Gridfinity Friction Fit Magnet Jig (Palm handle remix)](https://www.printables.com/model/595230-gridfinity-friction-fit-magnet-jig-palm-handle-rem/files). As the magnets need to be inserted into the carrier from the bottom, be sure to use the "bin" version of the jig.
